# Keeper AI Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for security, scaling, and best practices for the Keeper AI project.

## Security Recommendations

### API Keys and Secrets

- **Never expose API keys on the client side**

  - Store all API keys in environment variables
  - Access Google Books API and OpenAI API exclusively from server-side routes
  - Create a proxy API route in Next.js for client requests

- **Environment Variables**

  - Use `.env.local` for local development
  - Set up proper environment variables in Vercel
  - Never commit `.env` files to the repository

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement rate limiting for API routes
  - Use middleware to prevent abuse

### Authentication with Clerk

- **Implementation Best Practices**

  - Use Clerk's official Next.js SDK
  - Protect sensitive routes with middleware
  - Use server-side authentication checks for API routes
  - Implement proper loading and error states

- **User Management**

  - Allow social authentication options
  - Implement passwordless authentication when possible
  - Set up proper redirect URLs for authentication flows
  - Handle authentication state in client components with hooks

- **Input Validation**
  - Validate all user inputs
  - Use zod or similar libraries for schema validation
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS attacks

### Data Protection

- **User Data**

  - Minimize collection of personal data
  - Implement proper data deletion procedures
  - Be transparent about data usage

## Scaling Recommendations

### Performance Optimization

- **Image Optimization**

  - Use Next.js Image component
  - Implement proper image caching
  - Set appropriate image sizes

- **API Response Caching**

  - Cache Google Books API responses
  - Implement SWR or React Query for data fetching
  - Use stale-while-revalidate pattern

- **Component Optimizations**
  - Use React.memo for pure components
  - Implement virtualization for long lists
  - Optimize component re-renders

### Database Scaling (If Implemented)

- **Indexing**

  - Create proper indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Monitor query performance

- **Connection Pooling**
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Set appropriate pool sizes

### Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Vercel Edge Network**

  - Leverage Vercel's edge caching
  - Configure caching headers appropriately

- **CDN**

  - Use CDN for static assets
  - Configure proper caching policies

- **Serverless Functions**
  - Keep function size small
  - Optimize cold start times
  - Consider edge functions for low-latency requirements

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

- **Code Reviews**

  - Implement mandatory code reviews
  - Use a checklist for reviews
  - Focus on security, performance, and maintainability

- **Linting and Formatting**

  - Use ESLint with appropriate rules
  - Use Prettier for code formatting
  - Enforce consistent style

- **Documentation**
  - Keep documentation up-to-date
  - Document complex logic
  - Create clear API documentation

### Testing

- **Test Coverage**

  - Aim for high test coverage
  - Focus on testing business logic
  - Test edge cases thoroughly

- **E2E Testing**

  - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
  - Use Cypress or Playwright

- **CI/CD**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines
  - Run tests and linting on PRs
  - Automate deployment processes

### Monitoring and Analytics

- **Error Tracking**

  - Implement error tracking with Sentry or similar tool
  - Set up alerts for critical errors

- **Performance Monitoring**

  - Monitor Core Web Vitals
  - Track API response times
  - Identify bottlenecks

- **User Analytics**
  - Track user behavior (with consent)
  - Use analytics to drive feature development

### Accessibility

- **WCAG Compliance**

  - Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Use tools like axe for testing
  - Consider diverse user needs

- **Keyboard Navigation**

  - Ensure all features are keyboard accessible
  - Use proper focus management

- **Screen Reader Support**
  - Test with screen readers
  - Use proper ARIA attributes

### User Experience

- **Mobile Optimization**

  - Design for mobile-first
  - Test on various devices and browsers
  - Ensure touch targets are properly sized

- **Error States**

  - Design clear error states
  - Provide helpful error messages
  - Implement graceful fallbacks

- **Loading States**
  - Design pleasant loading states
  - Use skeleton screens
  - Minimize perceived loading time

## AI Usage Guidelines

- **Prompt Engineering**

  - Craft clear prompts for OpenAI API
  - Provide sufficient context for better summaries
  - Implement a feedback loop to improve prompts

- **Content Moderation**

  - Filter inappropriate content
  - Implement user reporting system
  - Review AI-generated content

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement fair usage policies
  - Consider token usage and costs
  - Optimize prompt length and complexity

## Billing and Premium Features

- **Tiered Subscription Model**

  - Free tier: Limited summaries per month (3-5)
  - Basic tier ($5-10/month): More summaries (15-20/month)
  - Premium tier ($15-20/month): Unlimited summaries

- **Credit-Based System**

  - Users purchase credits
  - Different summary types cost different credits
  - Bulk discounts for purchasing more credits

- **Payment Processing**
  - Use Stripe for payment processing
  - Implement webhook handling for subscription events
  - Handle subscription state changes properly
  - Provide clear billing information to users

## Future Recommendations
