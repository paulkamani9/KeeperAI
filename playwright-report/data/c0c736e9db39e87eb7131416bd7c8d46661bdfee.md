Intentionally designed for various levels of interest and ability of learners, this book is suitable for students, engineers, and even researchers in a variety of disciplines. No advanced programming experience is needed, and only a few school-level programming skill are needed. In the first chapter, you will learn to use several widgets in PyQt5: Display a welcome message; Use the Radio Button widget; Grouping radio buttons; Displays options in the form of a check box; and Display two groups of check boxes. In chapter two, you will learn to use the following topics: Using Signal / Slot Editor; Copy and place text from one Line Edit widget to another; Convert data types and make a simple calculator; Use the Spin Box widget; Use scrollbars and sliders; Using the Widget List; Select a number of list items from one Widget List and display them on another Widget List widget; Add items to the Widget List; Perform operations on the Widget List; Use the Combo Box widget; Displays data selected by the user from the Calendar Widget; Creating a hotel reservation application; and Display tabular data using Table Widgets. In third chapter, you will learn: How to create the initial three tables project in the School database: Teacher, Class, and Subject tables; How to create database configuration files; How to create a Python GUI for inserting and editing tables; How to create a Python GUI to join and query the three tables. In fourth chapter, you will learn how to: Create a main form to connect all forms; Create a project will add three more tables to the school database: Student, Parent, and Tuition tables; Create a Python GUI for inserting and editing tables; Create a Python GUI to join and query over the three tables. In the last chapter, you will join the six classes, Teacher, TClass, Subject, Student, Parent, and Tuition and make queries over those tables."

                - paragraph [ref=e395] [cursor=pointer]: Written by an expert in the game industry, Christer Ericson's new book is a comprehensive guide to the components of efficient real-time collision detection systems. The book provides the tools and know-how needed to implement industrial-strength collision detection for the highly detailed dynamic environments of applications such as 3D games, virtual reality applications, and physical simulators. Of the many topics covered, a key focus is on spatial and object partitioning through a wide variety of grids, trees, and sorting methods. The author also presents a large collection of intersection and distance tests for both simple and complex geometric shapes. Sections on vector and matrix algebra provide the background for advanced topics such as Voronoi regions, Minkowski sums, and linear and quadratic programming. Of utmost importance to programmers but rarely discussed in this much detail in other books are the chapters covering numerical and geometric robustness, both essential topics for collision detection systems. Also unique are the chapters discussing how graphics hardware can assist in collision detection computations and on advanced optimization for modern computer architectures. All in all, this comprehensive book will become the industry standard for years to come.
